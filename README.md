# Project Description
This repository containes various deep learning projects from my CS474 course at BYU. All projects made use of PyTorch. Some notable projects are
- 4: Cancer Detection UNet: I created a UNET by hand to determine which pixels in an medical image refer to cancerous cells
- 7: Style Transfer: I used a neural network to artifically create images with the syle of one image and content of another
- 8: Self Attention: I created a transformer by hand
- 9: Transfer Learning: I started with a pre-trained ResNet-152 classify bird species
- 10: Diffusion: I used a diffusion model to artifically generate images of hand-written digits
- 11: DeepRL: I built a DQN and PPO RL algorithm
